    ## Conclusion  
                
    We can see that every channel in the database sports a more or less **progressive decrease** in news coverage with time,
    and a general **downward trend**.  
    This trend starting in the years **between 2010 and 2013**. The rate of the decrease has different reasons depending
    on the channel at hand, but the global trend can be explained by **the rise of 24-hour news channels**, like BFMTV or LCI, which are
    unfortunately not featured in the data presented in this dashboard. With information becoming more accessible at all times on specialized
    channels, more generalist channels decided to opt for **more alleviated news bulletins**, discussing only the most relevant and essential news.  
    
    Regarding the **steep drop** that can commonly be observed on most graphs **between 2019 and 2020**, we know thanks to the dataframe analysis
    conducted earlier that the samples for the year 2020 are truncated of about 25%, as **no data is featured beyond September 2020**. Thus,
    the only meaning behind this steep drop is the **natural imbalance in the dataset**.

    ### Partial conclusion : TF1, France 2 and France 3
                
    We can notice that **the repartition of themes on TF1, France 2 and France 3 follows the general trend very closely**, with
    **society, sports, international and economy** being the **most covered** topics. This tracks, as we already
    know from the preliminary dataframe analysis that TF1, France 2 and France 3 are **generalist channels**.
    Moreover, it seems that **all three channels contribute heavily to the total population of news coverage**
    on each topic. This can be explained by **news broadcasts being some of the core programs** of all three channels
    (The 'JT 20 Heures', the biggest news bulletin of the evening on TF1, has its equivalents on France 2 and France 3, 
     along with the 'JT 13 Heures', the midday news bulletin.)
    
    **Thus, all three channels follow the general trend as generalist channels, with their twice-daily news bulletins contributing
    heavily to the total news coverage.**
