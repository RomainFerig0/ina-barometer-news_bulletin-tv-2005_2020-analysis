    Although this database is supposed to cover the years from 2005 to 2020, we can see that a 'yearly'

    see radical changes in the data starting 2020, and should not take it into account. For studying
    data on the year 2020 precisely, we will prefer to zoom in with a 'monthly' POV, in order to
    capture the true nature of the evolution of the data.
