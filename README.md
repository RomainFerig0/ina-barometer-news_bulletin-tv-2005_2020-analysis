# Dashboard : Analysis of the INA Thematic Barometer for French News Bulletins (2005 - 2020)

## Project description

## Data

The data was extracted from the French government's official [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr) website and can be found [right here](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/classement-thematique-des-sujets-de-journaux-televises-janvier-2005-septembre-2020).

## Setup

#### -- Open the terminal for your coding environment

#### -- Install streamlit
- (`pip install streamlit`)
  
Optional : Validate the installation by running the Hello app
- (`streamlit hello`)
#### -- Access the folder storing the source code of the app
- (`cd [enter path here]`)
#### -- Run the Hello.py file using streamlit
- (`streamlit run Hello.py`)
#### -- Following a short loading period, the Streamlit app should open on your browser

## Warnings (to read before usage) :

```diff
Due to defaults in the construction of the original .CSV file rendering it unusable (header split between the 1st and 2nd rows),
the actual data used by the dataframe comes from a slightly modified .CSV file, which can be found in the 'data' folder
of the source code.
```
